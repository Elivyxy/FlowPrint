Roadmap
=======

This part of the documentation keeps track of desired features in future releases.

- Add usage examples to documentation
- Cleanup of Flow API and documentation

Nice to haves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Features that are listed here would be nice to have for FlowPrint.
I probably won't implement them myself, but feel free to send me a pull request.

- Read from a live capture
- Visualisation module that plots the Clusters, CrossCorrelationGraph and Fingerprints live while running.
